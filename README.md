# Slayermusiq1 Quest Guide Plugin for RuneLite
This plugin adds a right-click option to quests in the quest tab that opens a browser with the Slayermusiq1 YouTube video guide for the quest clicked.

## Slayermusiq1
I thought of this idea because I wanted to make more RuneLite plugins and wanted to make one that is useful to me and others. I always used Slayermusiq1's guides for quests so I decided to make a plugin to make it a bit easier to get to all the guides.
